# Splined Voronoi Planner
## Overview
In the `Overview`-chapter you describe the content of this folder, either in text or a listing. For example:

This folder acts as an example for all the future students that will upload their code to this repository. I contains an example ROS-package that only contains a `README`-file to show how a package should be documented. Also any additional Matlab- or Python-script for the analysis of data should be added here.
