This repository contains all code of the students working at the Institut of Assembly Technology of the Leibniz University Hannover.

## How to add your code
There are two methods for adding your code. The first is only using the Github-Webinterface. The second option is by cloning the repository and working on your computer.

Here is the manual for the first method:
1. Fork this repository by clicking on the `fork`-button: ![ForkButton](documentation/fork_button.png). Afterwards click `Create fork`.

3. Add another line to the table at the bottom. (You can copy the line of the student above for the structure)
4. Column `Id`: Increase the previous line by 1. Please memorize the `Id`, as it will be used in `step 10`
5. Column `Thesis title`: Insert the title of your thesis.
6. Column `Description`: Explain in one sentence what algorithm or code you developed in your thesis.
7. Type in a meaningful commit message and commit the changes to the `README.md`-file.
8. Add a folder directly below `match_student_code` with a `README.md` file by clicking the `Add file`-button: ![AddFileButton](documentation/add_file_button.png) and select `Add new file`. 
9. Think of a name that summarizes your work/algorithm. This name is used in the next step.
10. Behind `match_student_code/` type `Id_AddYourNameHere/README.md`. Insert the `Id` from `step 4` and the name you thought of from `step 9`.
11. Navigate into the created folder.
12. Add all packages and additional files into the folder by clicking the `Add file`-button: ![AddFileButton] and then `Upload files`. Drag and drop all folders or files to upload.
13. Type in a meaningful commit message and commit the changes.
